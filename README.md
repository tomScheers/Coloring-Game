## About

This project was started to boost my JavaScript development skills and learn a thing or two. The project covers three different languages:

-   HTML.
-   SCSS.
-   JS. <br>
    It was developed using VS-Code and git, and I've also grown more confident in these tools.

## Gameplay

You start your new drawing project, and you can draw something beautiful for yourself or for others! You've lots of colors in display to choose from, and you may even create your own custom colors!
